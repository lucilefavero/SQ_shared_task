rrd,atraveller_82_2,"Our only trouble came with Delta.
On flights to and from Atlanta to El Salvador, I requested a nutfree buffer zone as listed as an option on the Delta website.
This request was not observed on either flight,
and I when mentioned it to the cabin crew on one segment, they began taking back the nuts from the passengers around us, pointing out that they couldn't have it because ""that little boy is allergic.""
This made us very uncomfortable, but at least the other passengers were polite about it.
I find it amazing that people get so incensed about ""their rights"" to have nuts being infringed upon.
I have a feeling that these are the same people who would be the first to complain when a plane has to make an emergency landing when a nutallergic passenger goes into anaphylaxis.",['Example'],"[{'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_S', 'cq': ""How do the author's personal feelings and biases about nut allergies and passenger rights influence their interpretation of the situation and their argument?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_L', 'cq': 'Is it the responsibility of the airline (Delta) to ensure that this accommodation is observed, or should it be the responsibility of the passenger to take precautions?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_L', 'cq': 'How common are severe nut allergies, and what is the likelihood of an allergic reaction occurring on a flight?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_S', 'cq': 'Is it fair to assume that people who object to nut-free buffer zones would also be the first to complain about emergency landings due to anaphylaxis, or is this a straw man argument?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_S', 'cq': ""Is the author's personal experience with Delta representative of the airline's overall policy and practice regarding nut-free buffer zones?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_2_S', 'cq': ""Were the cabin crew's actions in taking back nuts from passengers around the author's seat an appropriate response to the situation, or was it an overreaction?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_7_L', 'cq': 'Should airlines have a clear policy in place for accommodating passengers with nut allergies, and if so, what should that policy entail?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_4_S', 'cq': 'What is the prevalence of nut allergies and anaphylaxis on flights, and how significant is the risk of a medical emergency occurring due to nut exposure?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_7_S', 'cq': ""Are there any other factors that may have contributed to the cabin crew's response, such as airline policy, passenger behavior, or crew training, that are not being considered in the author's account?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_S', 'cq': 'How common is it for passengers to request nut-free buffer zones, and is it a reasonable accommodation to expect from airlines?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_L', 'cq': 'Is the request for a nut-free buffer zone a reasonable accommodation for passengers with nut allergies?', 'label': 'Unhelpful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_5_S', 'cq': 'Are there other ways to accommodate passengers with nut allergies beyond creating a nut-free buffer zone, such as providing alternative snacks or having emergency medication on hand?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_2_L', 'cq': 'How effective is the method of taking back nuts from passengers around the allergic individual, and is it a reasonable solution?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_L', 'cq': 'Is the author\'s characterization of people who object to nut-free zones as being overly concerned with their ""rights"" a fair representation, or is it a straw man argument?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_4_L', 'cq': 'Is the hypothetical scenario of a plane making an emergency landing due to an allergic reaction a realistic and likely consequence of not accommodating nut-allergic passengers?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'atraveller_82_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_5_L', 'cq': 'Are there other ways to accommodate nut-allergic passengers that do not infringe on the rights of others, such as providing nut-free snacks or creating designated nut-free areas on the plane?', 'label': 'Useful'}]",['ERExample']
rrd,SWong_118_2,"We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight.
We may not be so lucky next time because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last.
Even though we were on a peanutfree fight, my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight.
If peanuts are banned on all flights, my son would have been safe.
When an allergic reaction occurs high up in the sky over a huge ocean, and an epipen injection can only give a person an extra 20 minutes, there is not enough time to turn the plane around and take the person to the hospital.
I believe that it is reasonable to ban peanuts from airline flights if that assures the safety of a passenger that has a severe peanut allergy.

rrd,lauraclare_136,"I have two children with potentially life threatening allergies to peanuts.
Unlike what one person commented, this is not a latest illness fad.
The latest research indicates that peanut allergy doubled in children from 1997 to 2002 and that number continues to increase.
It is one of the most deadly food allergies.
The presence of nuts on planes is a real fear.
While my kids have other potentially deadly food allergies,
peanuts pose a unique risk.
Nuts break into fine pieces with dust that can become airborne.
Peanut butter is sticky and gets wiped on seats and tray tables.
Even the slightest microscopic amount of nuts can create an anaphylactic reaction.
Although EpiPens can help,
they are not 100% effective
and should not be considered a solution to the risk peanuts pose to allergic individuals on planes.
Additional steroids, Benadryl shots, oxygen and other medical intervention may be necessary to stop an anaphylactic reaction.
EpiPens may need to be administered every 15 to 30 minutes as well.
People still die even with intervention.
Please help protect people by offering people the opportunity to get peanut free flights or ban the sale and serving of nut products on the planes.",['PracticalReasoning'],"[{'id': 'lauraclare_136_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_9_L', 'cq': 'Are there any potential unintended consequences of banning peanuts on planes?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'lauraclare_136_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_5_L', 'cq': 'What are the alternative solutions to banning peanuts on planes?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'lauraclare_136_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_S', 'cq': ""What is the author's expertise in the field of allergies and medicine?

Regardless of how many caveats an airline might state in its contract terms, passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.
Bumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity, like so many other aspects of airline behavior.
From that objective, it follows that there should be NO cap on compensation

""Carriers recognize the importance of timely and accurate flight information, as evidenced by the fact that many of the largest U.S. carriers promise through their customer service plans to provide passengers all known information about delays and cancellations as soon as they become aware of the issue"" (48).

I find it interesting that you claim neither passengers nor profits to be benefiting from the current state of air transit affairs.
Now, air fare is affordable (prices of air fares have decreased 25% since 1991) and more available to citizens than ever before.

rrd,drgreg_181_1,"I believe airlines should be forced to fully reimburse confirmed passengers whenever the airline changes flight schedules after booking.
I frequently reserve flights up to one year in advance, in order to secure the lowest price and best seat.
I do this even though the airline will charge me $150 (plus fare difference) to change my itinerary for personal reasons once booked.
However, the airline frequently change flight schedules for confirmed passengers without compensation, nor consideration of passengers' plans.
For example, a trip to Europe on United Airlines has now been changed 7 times by the airline since I confirmed my reservation in December 2009.
The resulting changes have added nearly 5 hours to the total trip, plus I'm now required to leave at 3AM for the airport (instead of my original departure of 8AM), and I return after midnight, rather than a more reasonable 10:30PM.
In addition, United Airlines has not offered to waive the change fee, nor provide seats on alternate dates or airline partners.
If I'm required to pay exorbitant fees to the airlines to change my original itinerary, due to personal circumstances, then the airlines should also be required to compensate inconvenienced passengers in full AND provide satisfactory alternate travel arrangements comparable to the original flight schedule.
Perhaps this would force the airlines to recognize the hardships they create for passengers when schedules are revised after passengers have already received confirmed flights and make related travel arrangements.","['PracticalReasoning', 'Example']","[{'id': 'drgreg_181_1_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_S', 'cq': ""Are the author's expectations about airline policies reasonable, or are they based on unrealistic assumptions?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'drgreg_181_1_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_S', 'cq': ""Are there any potential biases or conflicts of interest that may influence the author's opinion?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'drgreg_181_1_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_2_L', 'cq': 'Would requiring airlines to fully reimburse passengers for changes to flight schedules lead to increased costs for airlines, and if so, how would this affect ticket prices for all passengers?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'drgreg_181_1_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_4_S', 'cq': ""Are there alternative solutions that could address the author's concerns without imposing a blanket requirement for full reimbursement?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'drgreg_181_1_T__1', 'cq': 'Are there other relevant goals that conflict with forcing the airlines to recognize the hardships they create for passengers when schedules are revised after passengers have already received confirmed flights and make related travel arrangements.?', 'label': 'Unhelpful'}, {'id': 'drgreg_181_1_T__5', 'cq': 'Is it actually the case that a client that needs to change their flight for their own reasons needs to pay change fees?

rrd,JetJock_156_2,"If we were in preregulation days where an airline was making money with only 60% of the seats filled, flights canceling due to the 3 hour limit would not be much of a problem.
What is a problem is flights that are now being canceled because of the new rule
and virtually no seats available on subsequent flights to accommodate those passengers.
If the ground delays are due to ATC, weather, VIP movement (president in the area) then passengers will not be, as a rule, given cancellation perks since they are beyond the control of the company.
If the air conditioning, and restrooms are functioning properly and there are plenty of beverages and snacks on board then that maximum number of hours should be flexible.
I would be curious to hear from people that had their flight cancel due to the 3 hour limit and how the airlines handled them after that.
My guess this rule will cause greater damage to air travel then the occasional extended ground hold on an airplane with poor air conditioning or nonfunctioning lavatories.

BUT, being a frequent traveler, I see all sorts of problems which are unavoidable and for which the airlines will be blamed by giving such notice with the intend that some flyers may be able to delay thier trip to the airport or even the departure gate.
I know that many times the airlines can't also know exactly when a weather hold or a maintenance issue will be rectified and that the flight is then ready to go.
Many time it can be surprisingly faster than expected.
The problem is that some flyers may then  wait before going to the airport,
but then find that the problem was rectified sooner than expected and the flight departed.
Of course the flyer and the flyers rights organization will then crucify the airlines for such poor planning.
Flyers need to grow up and quit pouting and blaming everthing on the airlines.

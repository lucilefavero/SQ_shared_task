rrd,cd38_220_2,"The return flight is 6 ½ hours (plus commute time to the airport);
when time allows, I make something to bring on the flight,
but if my mother is having a bad day, that's not always possible.
On a recent trip, I didn't have time to eat anything at all the day I flew home; got stuck in traffic and barely made my flight (I was the last one on) so didn't have time to eat or buy anything at the airport; and as we started to taxi, the flight crew announced that we had a nut allergy on board, and that they (JB) would not be serving cashews and requested that we not eat any nuts we may have brought on board.
6 ½ hours feels pretty long at that point!
No, it didn't kill me,
but it does seem that if JB hadn't served cashews, the risks involved in one or two people eating nuts they may have brought with them would have been extremely, extremely small....
and, NOTHING in life is riskfree.
I understand that people want to minimize the risks for their loved ones,
but you cannot eliminate the risk completely, regardless of what legislation you put in place.
If I ate peanuts at the airport, didn't wash my hands, and then opened the rest room door on the plane immediately before a peanut allergy sufferer, that person could suffer a reaction.
I can support airlines not serving peanuts/peanut products,
thereby eliminating the most likely possible cause of a peanutrelated incident on a flight;
but not restrictions on what people may choose to eat.",['Example'],"[{'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_2_S', 'cq': 'Is the risk of an allergic reaction truly ""extremely, extremely small"" as the writer claims, or are there other factors at play?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_L', 'cq': 'Is the author\'s distinction between ""eliminating the most likely possible cause of a peanut-related incident on a flight"" and ""restrictions on what people may choose to eat"" a meaningful distinction, or is it a false dichotomy?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_5_S', 'cq': 'Is the writer\'s statement ""NOTHING in life is risk-free"" a valid argument against taking precautions to minimize risks, or is it a false dichotomy?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_4_S', 'cq': 'What are the potential consequences of not restricting what people can eat on a flight, and are they significant enough to warrant some level of regulation?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_4_L', 'cq': ""Is the author's scenario of eating peanuts at the airport, not washing their hands, and then opening the restroom door on the plane immediately before a peanut allergy sufferer a realistic and likely scenario, or is it a hypothetical extreme case?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_S', 'cq': ""Does the writer's argument rely too heavily on anecdotal evidence, and are there other perspectives or evidence that should be considered?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_S', 'cq': 'How common are severe allergic reactions to nuts on flights, and what are the consequences of such reactions?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_5_L', 'cq': ""Does the author's support for airlines not serving peanuts/peanut products imply that they acknowledge the risks associated with peanut allergies on flights, and if so, why do they not support restrictions on what people may choose to eat?"", 'label': 'Unhelpful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_L', 'cq': 'Does the author\'s statement ""NOTHING in life is risk-free"" imply that some level of risk is acceptable, and if so, what level of risk is acceptable in the context of peanut allergies on flights?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_2_L', 'cq': 'Is the author\'s claim that the risks involved in one or two people eating nuts they may have brought with them would have been ""extremely, extremely small"" supported by evidence or data?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_S', 'cq': 'How would the writer propose to balance the needs of individuals with severe allergies with the desire for personal freedom and choice in what they eat on a flight?', 'label': 'Unhelpful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_L', 'cq': 'Does the author\'s statement ""6 ½ hours feels pretty long at that point!"" imply that the lack of food on the flight was a significant hardship, and if so, is this relevant to the argument about peanut allergies?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_L', 'cq': ""Is the author's personal experience of not being able to eat on a flight due to circumstances beyond their control relevant to the argument about peanut allergies on flights?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_S', 'cq': ""Is the writer's personal experience representative of the average person's experience, or is it an exceptional case?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_7_L', 'cq': 'Are there any other measures that could be taken to minimize the risks associated with peanut allergies on flights, beyond not serving peanuts/peanut products and restricting what people may choose to eat?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'cd38_220_2_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_7_S', 'cq': 'Are there other measures that airlines could take to minimize the risk of allergic reactions, such as providing allergy-friendly snacks or having emergency protocols in place?', 'label': 'Useful'}]",['ERExample']

Most food allergies are completely imagined.

I sincerely doubt it.
Peanuts are incredibly nutritious,
almost universally enjoyed,

Simply put, pound for pound there is no better food on the planet.

Mulder: ""Apparently Samsmom is the ignorant one.
She attacks what she clearly does not understand.
If her child has a true peanut allergy that is so severe, he shouldn't be flying,
since her argument is that any contact with peanut dust or oil would cause anaphylactic shock.
Since that possibility is very real even outside an airline cabin,
she's making her own argument for living in a bubble.
Facts are stubborn things,
and one of those facts is that the air onboard an airliner is cleaner than in most public buildings,
so there's very little, if any, real risk involved in flying on a jet where peanuts have been consumed before or are even being served now.
Another stubborn fact is that you can be desensitized to peanut allergies,
but if you're unwilling to do it, don't blame others for not bending to your petty fears.
Nobody has studied this subject,
so there's no hard data.
But we do know that the air onboard an airliner is much cleaner than people think.
Only one confirmed death onboard an airliner has been reported,
but it may have been as far back as 1998,
and it was an Eastern European airline.","['Ad hominem', 'ExpertOpinion']","[{'id': 'Antanagoge_227_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_L', 'cq': ""How does the study's findings translate to real-world scenarios, and what are the practical implications for peanut-sensitive travelers?"", 'label': 'Invalid'}, {'id': 'Antanagoge_227_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_L', 'cq': 'What is the methodology of the study, and is it reliable and unbiased?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'Antanagoge_227_T__4', 'cq': 'Is this study done by genuine experts in peanut allergies?

rrd,howie_201,"First, stop reading that propaganda magazine.
Publications like that only serve to create fear in minds like yours.
Second, how old is your kid?
If under 5, relax the sensitivity will probably go away by the time he is 5.
Third, go to a real doctor  not an allergist and see if there is really even a problem at all.
This supposed plague of food allergies is the result of very clever advertising by this profession of pseudoscientists.
Allergists are not doctors.
I sincerely doubt you ""know plenty of people who will die if they do have peanuts or breathe in peanut dust"".
Almost noone is actually that allergic.
Lot's of people think they are much worse off than they really are.
Methinks you have an agenda.
Highly suspicious that the child of a physician who is hyper aware of bad things that can happen coincidentally has not one, but three life threatening allergies.
Have you heard of Munchasen by Proxy?
Do you realize that most kids have mild reactions to various food items that they invariably grow out of by the age of 5?
Food allergies have to be the most overblown imagined health problem of our time.
Hypochondriacs all.""
 < this message is answering to > 
jsooudi: ""I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.
My son's dairy allergy is severe,
and he has had numerous lifethreatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk,
which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.
Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse,
but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut;
he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.
I've traveled with my children
and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanutfree buffer zone or flight.
Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.
(So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)
I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right.""
Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.
Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.
However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.
My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.
The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.
If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.
If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.
Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.
But milk is ubiquitous,
and milk allergy relatively uncommon,
so we must protect ourselves.
Peanut allergy is common,
and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.
So why is this a big problem?
The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.
Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein,
and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.
As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.
I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.
In addition, most epipens come in two pack doses,
each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.
Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.
I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive,
and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.
I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.
Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.
But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.
This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.
""Hi.  My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.
I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.
If I eat a peanut I'll get sick.
I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.
It was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.
I would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.
Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.""",['Ad hominem'],"[{'id': 'howie_201_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_L', 'cq': 'What evidence does Howie have to support his claim that publications about food allergies are propaganda, and what criteria does he use to distinguish propaganda from credible sources of information?', 'label': 'Unhelpful'}, {'id': 'howie_201_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_L', 'cq': 'What evidence does Howie have to support his claim that the profession of allergists is engaging in ""very clever advertising"" and that food allergies are not a legitimate health concern?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'howie_201_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_L', 'cq': 'What is the basis for Howie\'s assertion that sensitivity to peanuts will ""probably go away"" by the time a child is 5 years old, and what is the scientific consensus on this issue?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'howie_201_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_7_L', 'cq': 'What is the basis for Howie\'s claim that most kids have mild reactions to food items that they ""invariably grow out of"" by the age of 5, and what is the scientific consensus on the natural history of food allergies?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'howie_201_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_L', 'cq': 'How does Howie define a ""life-threatening allergy,"" and what is the scientific consensus on the criteria for diagnosing and treating severe food allergies?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'howie_201_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_S', 'cq': 'What evidence does the author provide to support their claims that food allergies are overblown or imagined?

On one side is the fact that sitting for an excessive amount of time is uncomfortable at best and unhealthy at worst.
However, on the other side there will be considerable time lost with the deplaning and reboarding.
One item which should be addressed is food and drink.
If the airline would normally have food for the passengers on that flight it seems silly to deny access to anything more than a bag of peanuts and a glass of water.
This happened to my husband last week on a Delta flight from Newark to Amsterdam.
The passengers were sitting on the plane for over six hours, at the gate,
but they were only offered one bag of peanuts and a glass of water or orange juice.
The plane eventually took off at approximately 1 a.m.,

And then finally, if I could just ask you, there’s a danger I think when you kind of say, “The poor are the ones who suffer. The rich are the bad guys.”
It is the case that some of the greatest examples of social progress over the years have come from well-off rich people, banks and so on, investing productively
Isn’t the problem that the only thing the banks have done is kind of consumer credit?

you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb , very famous pictures
I do n't think you can deny that
just last week , your campaign manager said it was true
when you tried to act holier than thou , it really does n't work
as far as the lawsuit , yes , when I was very young , I went into my father 's company , had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens , and we , along with many , many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued

Perhaps advocacy groups for those who are peanutallergic will approach the major carriers to voluntarily set aside seating blocks that are reserved for allergy sufferers, and nonsufferers who are willing to agree not to eat peanuts while sitting in that particular block.
As someone who suffers from a medical condition which requires me to carry my ""rescue"" medication with me everywhere I go,
I think that if the risk to an allergy sufferer is deemed to be significant, then they should
consider alternate travel methods other than flying,
ensure they have sufficient ""rescue"" medication to last the entire time they might be stuck in an aircraft,
they should wear appropriate clothing / face masks to minimize exposed skin and inhalation risk.
Requiring other passengers to forgo their ""right"" to eat peanuts so as to accommodate the ""right"" of allergy sufferers to fly seems a bit much,

rrd,aimwill_178,"Perhaps i am missing something here
If airlines are selling the seats for full price and people don't show up for the flight, doesn't the airline still pocket that money?
And with the hubbub about the extra weight of luggage, wouldn't having a few empty seats DECREASE the cost of the flight by increasing fuel efficiency?
Like I said, I may be missing a key detail, but it really does seem like the airlines are gambling that people won't show up and they can get paid twice for the same seat.
If the airlines are refunding people based on them missing flights, perhaps stopping THAT practice and disallowing overbooking would solve the problem??

rrd,dberger_74_1,"There must be a complete ban on tree nuts and peanuts on planes.
It is a closed space.
I am allergic to peanuts and almonds
and I am impacted every time I fly.
A nut free zone does not work
since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.
For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.
For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested
so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.
This is not true for many of us with nut allergies
we react if other people are eating the food
since it is an airborne allergy.
I do fly but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.
This works for now
but I always wonder when it will no longer be enough.
An epipen is not the answer
as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land
which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water
and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.
The rules airlines have are ridiculous
Southwest is not nut free
they will not serve nuts
but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.
Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free'
but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.","['Example', 'PracticalReasoning']","[{'id': 'dberger_74_1_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_S', 'cq': 'Could airlines implement other measures to minimize the risk of allergic reactions?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'dberger_74_1_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_S', 'cq': 'What about other allergens?** If we ban nuts and peanuts on planes, should we also consider banning other common allergens, such as dairy or gluten products?', 'label': 'Invalid'}, {'id': 'dberger_74_1_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_9_L', 'cq': 'How does the risk of a severe allergic reaction on a flight compare to other risks associated with air travel, and what is the appropriate balance between accommodating passengers with nut allergies and ensuring the overall safety and convenience of air travel?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'dberger_74_1_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_5_S', 'cq': 'Are there other ways to manage allergies?** Could passengers with severe nut allergies take additional precautions, such as wearing a mask or carrying an EpiPen, rather than relying on a ban?', 'label': 'Unhelpful'}, {'id': 'dberger_74_1_T__1', 'cq': 'Are there alternative actions to imposing a complete ban on tree nuts and peanuts on planes to achieve preventing nut allergic reactions on planes?

For example, the first time I ever flew without a parent (13 years ago), I was 7 years old, and I went with my older brother who was 10.
We flew from Chicago to Colorado with no incident.
However, that doesn't mean that every 7 or 10 year old can handle itmany can't, and shouldn't try.
It's something that the parents themselves should decide,

Also, be careful when talking about ""minors"" flying alone on airplanes.

That said, it seems arbitrary to ban peanuts and not tree nuts

However, supplying those items really should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy or, if it is a child, the caretaker.
Further, the logistics of implementing such a ban would be almost impossible.

PracticalJo: ""Take peanuts off of planes.
Safety first.
It is not only airborne particles that are problematical,
it is also the crumbs, whole peanuts that ""get away"" from the passenger (i.e., dropped on floor or in seat), and residue left behind on seats, seat belts, floors, tray tables and other surfaces.
Ingestion or contact can trigger severe reactions.
Take peanuts and items containing peanuts/peanut butter (e.g., trail mix, peanut butter crackers) off of airplanes.
This is all the airlines need to do.
Most airlines already have a suitable replacement snack.
Anyone with a severe allergy already has EpiPens or other medications.
Airlines need not provide these.
As an outsider to the airline industry, it is hard for me to say what level of cleaning currently occurs on an aircraft.
Obviously, on quick turnaround layovers, flight crews only have time for a cursory cleaning.
I don't know.
If so, perhaps repeated standard cleanings without further peanut exposure would be sufficient?
The rule probably has the best chance of being enacted if it minimizes overall cost to the airline industry while meeting the desired safety requirements.
Personally, I would be satisfied if the rule simply called for removal of peanuts from aircraft and allowed the airlines to put forth a good faith effort at cleaning their fleets.",['PracticalReasoning'],"[{'id': 'JJMurray_180_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_S', 'cq': 'Is the author assuming that all bans are equal, or are there different types of bans that might have different consequences?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'JJMurray_180_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_4_S', 'cq': ""Is the author's argument based on a fear of government overreach, or is it based on a concern for the impact of bans on individuals or businesses?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'JJMurray_180_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_7_L', 'cq': ""Are there any underlying assumptions or biases in the author's argument, such as a general opposition to regulation or a skepticism towards the severity of food allergies?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'JJMurray_180_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_5_S', 'cq': 'Are there any benefits to banning peanuts, such as protecting people with severe peanut allergies, that might outweigh the potential risks of a slippery slope?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'JJMurray_180_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_5_L', 'cq': ""Is the author's argument based on a false dichotomy, suggesting that the only options are to ban everything or ban nothing, when in fact there may be more nuanced and targeted approaches to addressing food allergies?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'JJMurray_180_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_S', 'cq': 'Are peanuts a unique case, or are there other products that have been banned without leading to a slippery slope of further bans?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'JJMurray_180_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_S', 'cq': 'Is the author\'s argument a form of the ""slippery slope fallacy,"" where a hypothetical chain of events is presented as inevitable without sufficient evidence?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'JJMurray_180_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_S', 'cq': 'Is there any evidence to support the claim that banning peanuts would lead to demands to ban other products?

rrd,Mulder_226,"Apparently Samsmom is the ignorant one.
She attacks what she clearly does not understand.
If her child has a true peanut allergy that is so severe, he shouldn't be flying,
since her argument is that any contact with peanut dust or oil would cause anaphylactic shock.
Since that possibility is very real even outside an airline cabin,
she's making her own argument for living in a bubble.
Facts are stubborn things,
and one of those facts is that the air onboard an airliner is cleaner than in most public buildings,
so there's very little, if any, real risk involved in flying on a jet where peanuts have been consumed before or are even being served now.
Another stubborn fact is that you can be desensitized to peanut allergies,
but if you're unwilling to do it, don't blame others for not bending to your petty fears.
Nobody has studied this subject,
so there's no hard data.
But we do know that the air onboard an airliner is much cleaner than people think.
Only one confirmed death onboard an airliner has been reported,
but it may have been as far back as 1998,
and it was an Eastern European airline.""
 < this message is answering to > 
Samsmom: ""I am utterly amazed at the ignorance displayed by some of those commenting here.
Allergies are not ""perceived""
as Mulder suggests,
and it is ridiculous and unrealistic  to suggest that people with severe food allergies ""live in a bubble"".
No one who has an allergy chooses to be in this situation,
and walking onto an airplane where peanuts either are being consumed or have been consumed is like playing Russian Roulette.
We are talking about a SNACK ON AN AIRPLANE.
Can you really be complaining about your rights to eat a snack?!?
My son could DIE because you can't forgo a snack for two hours.
While we could drive everywhere we need to go for the rest of his life,
there may come a time when time constraints force us to fly.
No matter how much ""responsibility we take"", we cannot sufficiently protect him if people around us are eating any peanut product.
We always carry an epipen,
and feel that should be our responsibility.
But, again, that may not be enough to save his life.
Those autoinjectors can only buy us 1015 minutes,
barely enough time for a plane to request an emergency landing site.
He would be dead before we taxied to the gate.
FOR A SNACK!!
An outright ban should be in place.",['Ad hominem'],"[{'id': 'Mulder_226_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_0_L', 'cq': ""Is the assumption that Samsmom's child's peanut allergy is not severe enough to warrant precautions accurate, or is it a straw man argument?"", 'label': 'Unhelpful'}, {'id': 'Mulder_226_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_4_L', 'cq': 'Is the lack of hard data on peanut allergies and airliners a reason to dismiss the concerns of individuals with peanut allergies, or should caution still be exercised?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'Mulder_226_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_S', 'cq': ""What is the basis for the author's claim that peanut allergies can be desensitized?

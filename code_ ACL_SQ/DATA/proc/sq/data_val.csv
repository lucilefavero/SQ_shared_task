rrd,darawayne_182,"This is the same as bumping and should be compensated (punishment to the airlines) as such.
It is not just the five hours, though that is bad enough; it is all the other inconveniences, arriving late at night, having to cancel engagements, having to call a cab for a long ride vs bus transportation, and a myriad other inconveniences for which the airlines in their hubris currently accepts no responsibility.""
 < this message is answering to > 
drgreg: ""I believe airlines should be forced to fully reimburse confirmed passengers whenever the airline changes flight schedules after booking.
I frequently reserve flights up to one year in advance, in order to secure the lowest price and best seat.
I do this even though the airline will charge me $150 (plus fare difference) to change my itinerary for personal reasons once booked.
However, the airline frequently change flight schedules for confirmed passengers without compensation, nor consideration of passengers' plans.
For example, a trip to Europe on United Airlines has now been changed 7 times by the airline since I confirmed my reservation in December 2009.
The resulting changes have added nearly 5 hours to the total trip, plus I'm now required to leave at 3AM for the airport (instead of my original departure of 8AM), and I return after midnight, rather than a more reasonable 10:30PM.
In addition, United Airlines has not offered to waive the change fee, nor provide seats on alternate dates or airline partners.
If I'm required to pay exorbitant fees to the airlines to change my original itinerary, due to personal circumstances, then the airlines should also be required to compensate inconvenienced passengers in full AND provide satisfactory alternate travel arrangements comparable to the original flight schedule.
Perhaps this would force the airlines to recognize the hardships they create for passengers when schedules are revised after passengers have already received confirmed flights and make related travel arrangements.",['PracticalReasoning'],"[{'id': 'darawayne_182_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_1_S', 'cq': 'Is it fair to equate a five-hour delay with bumping, which typically involves being denied boarding on a flight?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'darawayne_182_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_2_L', 'cq': 'How does the author propose that the airline should be punished for the delay, and what would be a fair compensation for the passenger?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'darawayne_182_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_4_L', 'cq': 'Is it reasonable to expect the airline to accept responsibility for all of the inconveniences caused by the delay, or are there limits to their liability?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'darawayne_182_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_3_L', 'cq': 'Are the ""other inconveniences"" mentioned by the author (e.g. arriving late at night, having to cancel engagements) a direct result of the airline\'s actions, or are they indirect consequences of the delay?', 'label': 'Unhelpful'}, {'id': 'darawayne_182_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_7_L', 'cq': ""How does the author's experience compare to the experiences of other passengers who may have been affected by the delay, and are there any differences in their circumstances that should be taken into account?"", 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'darawayne_182_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_S', 'cq': 'Are there any potential unintended consequences of punishing airlines for delays, such as increased ticket prices or reduced services?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'darawayne_182_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_6_L', 'cq': 'Are there any alternative solutions or compromises that could be proposed to address the issue of delays and inconveniences, rather than simply punishing the airline?', 'label': 'Useful'}, {'id': 'darawayne_182_LLM_rrd_D_meta-llama_Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct_2_S', 'cq': 'How do we quantify the ""inconveniences"" mentioned, such as arriving late at night or having to cancel engagements?

I would rather drive 1012 hours in my car than fly at this point.
I travel with my dog about twice a year.
Because he is 28 pnds, he has to be checked and travel in cargo.
It costs anywhere from $300400 round trip to take him.
I would rather be allowed to put him in a carrier that is secured by the seat belt and have him travel in the seat next to me (that I purchase a ticket for), especially if I have to pay the same or more for his ticket in cargo as I do for mine.
The cost and stress of handing him over to cargo is wearing me down and I will most likely not take him on some future trips so they will loose my business.

An auction will more accurately price the delay

An auction would also force the carriers to face the cost of overbooking in customer dissatisfaction and better inform their flight scheduling decisions.

but that was long, long ago and under far greater seat availability and lower probabilities of cascading delays and subsequent denials of boarding for those who took the compensation.

I certainly empathize with the folks with peanut allergies.
That said, it seems arbitrary to ban peanuts and not tree nuts

However, supplying those items really should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy or, if it is a child, the caretaker.
Further, the logistics of implementing such a ban would be almost impossible.
Are we looking at searching passenger luggage, banning the sale of all foods with peanuts

rrd,JetJock_156_1,"Yes, most airlines pay flight crew members scheduled flight time or actual time away from the gate whichever is more.
Eg. if a flight is scheduled for 2 hours ""block to block"" (from/to the gate) but it takes 3 to fly it, the crew gets 3.
If the flight leaves that gate and returns 2.5 hours later, most airlines only pay that crew either the 2.0 scheduled (if it cancels) or much less.
For most crewmembers, the notion that 1 hour at the gate, 2.5 hours of sitting on that taxiway and only get paid for 2 is not very palatable.
Whereas sitting for 2.5 hours then fly 2 totals 4.5.
It is mostly the pay structure of pilots/flight attendants that poorly designed.

Airlines need not provide these.
As an outsider to the airline industry, it is hard for me to say what level of cleaning currently occurs on an aircraft.
Obviously, on quick turnaround layovers, flight crews only have time for a cursory cleaning.
I don't know.
If so, perhaps repeated standard cleanings without further peanut exposure would be sufficient?
The rule probably has the best chance of being enacted if it minimizes overall cost to the airline industry while meeting the desired safety requirements.

http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodallergy/understanding/pages/quickfacts.aspx:
Food allergy occurs in 6 to 8 percent of children 4 years of age or under, and in 3.7 percent of adults.
Allergy to peanuts and tree nuts in the general population is, respectively, 0.6 percent and 0.4 percent, with the rate in children under age 18 (0.8 percent and 0.2 percent) slightly different from adults (0.6 percent and 0.5 percent respectively).
These two foods are the leading causes of fatal and near fatal foodallergic reactions.
In spite of attempts to avoid allergenic foods, accidental exposures are the major causes of allergic reactions to foods.
Over a period of two years, approximately 50 percent of subjects in the United States with food allergy have an allergic reaction to accidental exposure.
In the United States, there are approximately 30,000 episodes of foodinduced anaphylaxis, associated with 100 to 200 deaths;
most deaths occur in adolescents and young adults.

Once the plane has left the gate as long as it's officially waiting for takeoff, then it appears to me passengers should not be allowed to leave the gate.
However, I remember times while traveling thru Denver, United would leave the gate, then taxi to the ""penalty box"" waiting for clearances and take off instructions.
Airlines should not be allowed to leave the gate unless there is a expected takeoff time issued by FAA ATC Clearance Delivery and Ground Control.
If the expected departure time issued by FAA ATC is over 3 hours then the aircraft should not be allowed to leave the gate.
However, if an airline has left the gate, and the departure time is extended while waiting for takeoff,  where the total time is greater than three hours on the ground then the airport and airline should get buses out to the aircraft for any passengers that want to deplane.
